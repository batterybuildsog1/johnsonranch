# Solar Assistant Dashboard Recreation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to recreate the Solar Assistant dashboard in Home Assistant. We'll use the UI Lovelace Minimalist framework along with custom cards and styling to achieve a similar look and feel.

## Step 1: Create Basic Dashboard Structure ✅
- Create a new dashboard YAML file
- Set up the navigation bar with tabs (Dashboard, Charts, Totals, Power, Configuration)
- Configure the basic layout and theme

## Step 2: Implement Status Cards ✅
- Create card components for:
  - Inverter status (with battery mode)
  - Solar PV status (with daily and weekly production)
  - Grid connection status
  - Battery status (with percentage and charging rate)
- Style these cards to match the Solar Assistant UI

## Step 3: Implement Gauge Displays ✅
- Create circular gauge components for:
  - Load power (current consumption)
  - Solar PV power (current production)
  - Grid power (import/export)
  - Battery power (charge/discharge)
- Style these to match the circular indicators in Solar Assistant

## Step 4: Create Power Flow Graph ✅
- Implement a time-series graph showing:
  - Load power (blue line)
  - Grid power (red line)
  - PV power (yellow line)
  - Battery power
- Configure proper scaling and time range
- Add appropriate legends and labels

## Step 5: Final Styling and Refinement ✅
- Apply consistent color scheme matching Solar Assistant
- Ensure responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Add any missing details or refinements
- Test and adjust as needed

## Step 6: Documentation ✅
- Document the entities and cards used
- Note any custom styling and configurations
- Provide instructions for future modifications

## Notes
- We used card-mod for custom styling
- Mini-graph-card was used for the power flow visualization
- Button-card and auto-entities helped with the status displays
- We leveraged the existing UI Lovelace Minimalist framework
- ApexCharts card was used for the circular gauge displays
- The dashboard is organized with tabs matching the original Solar Assistant interface
