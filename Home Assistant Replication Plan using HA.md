Home Assistant Replication Plan using HACS

To replicate this in Home Assistant, we will primarily use custom cards available through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) to achieve the desired visual styles and functionalities. Here's a breakdown of components and how to recreate them:

1. Top Navigation Bar:

Component:  Horizontal Stack of Buttons

Home Assistant Cards:

button-card (HACS): This is an incredibly versatile card for creating custom buttons. We'll use it for each navigation item.
horizontal-stack (Built-in): To arrange the buttons in a row.
Implementation Steps:

Install button-card via HACS.
In your Home Assistant Dashboard (YAML mode is recommended for detailed customization), create a horizontal-stack card.
Inside the horizontal-stack, create button-card instances for each navigation item ("Dashboard", "Charts", "Totals", "Power", "Configuration").
Customize each button-card:
name: Set the text for each button (e.g., "Dashboard").
icon: You can add icons if desired (search for Material Design Icons).
tap_action: Configure what happens when you tap each button (e.g., type: navigate, navigation_path: /lovelace/charts if you create a "charts" view).
styles: Use card and label styles within button-card to match the font, color, and spacing of the Solar-Assistant navigation. You'll likely want a clean, minimalist style.
<!-- end list -->

YAML

type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:button-card
    name: Dashboard
    # icon: mdi:view-dashboard # Example Icon
    tap_action:
      action: navigate
      navigation_path: /lovelace/dashboard # Your main dashboard view
    styles: # Customize styles to match Solar-Assistant
      card: ...
      label: ...
  - type: custom:button-card
    name: Charts
    # ... (similar configuration for other buttons)
  - type: custom:button-card
    name: Totals
  - type: custom:button-card
    name: Power
  - type: custom:button-card
    name: Configuration
2. Overview Section:

Component:  Structured display of key metrics with icons and labels.

Home Assistant Cards:

vertical-stack (Built-in): To arrange rows of information vertically.
horizontal-stack (Built-in): To arrange items (icon, text, value) horizontally within each row.
icon or state-icon (Built-in): To display icons for Inverter, Solar PV, Grid, Battery. state-icon can change color based on state if applicable, but icon is likely sufficient for static icons.
markdown (Built-in): For displaying text labels ("Inverter", "Solar PV", "D:", "W:", etc.) and potentially values if you want more formatting control. Alternatively, entity card can also be used for displaying entity states directly.
Implementation Steps:

Create a vertical-stack card to contain the entire overview section.
Within the vertical-stack, create horizontal-stack cards for each row (Inverter, Solar PV, Grid, Battery).
Inside each horizontal-stack:
Use an icon card to display the relevant icon (e.g., mdi:solar-power for Solar PV, mdi:battery for Battery, etc. Find appropriate icons from Material Design Icons).
Use markdown cards (or entity cards) to display the text labels (e.g., "Inverter", "Solar PV", "D: ", "W: ") and the corresponding sensor values.
Crucially, you will need to replace placeholder values with your actual Home Assistant entities. For example, if your Solar PV Daily Energy is in a sensor named sensor.solar_pv_daily_energy, you would use entity: sensor.solar_pv_daily_energy in an entity card, or use templating in a markdown card.
<!-- end list -->

YAML

type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: horizontal-stack # Inverter Row
    cards:
      - type: icon
        icon: mdi:power-plug # Example Inverter Icon
      - type: markdown
        content: |
          **Inverter**
          Battery mode # Assuming 'Battery mode' is a static label or state-based text
  - type: horizontal-stack # Solar PV Row
    cards:
      - type: icon
        icon: mdi:solar-power
      - type: markdown
        content: |
          **Solar PV**
          D: {{ states('sensor.solar_pv_daily_energy') }} kWh # Replace with your daily energy entity
          W: {{ states('sensor.solar_pv_weekly_energy') }} kWh # Replace with your weekly energy entity
  # ... (Similar structure for Grid and Battery rows, replacing with your actual entities)
3. Real-time Power Gauges:

Component: Circular gauges for real-time power.

Home Assistant Cards:

mini-gauge-card (HACS): A good option for creating simple, stylized gauges. It can be customized to remove the needle and focus on the value and arc.
button-card (HACS) with custom styling: You can create very custom gauge-like appearances using button-card and CSS styling, potentially getting closer to the Solar-Assistant style.
gauge (Built-in): The built-in gauge card is quite basic but could be a starting point, though less visually similar to Solar-Assistant.
apexcharts-card (HACS): While primarily for charts, apexcharts-card can also create radial bar charts which could be styled to look like gauges, offering very high customization.
Implementation Steps (using mini-gauge-card as a starting point - you can explore button-card for more advanced styling later):

Install mini-gauge-card via HACS.
Create a horizontal-stack card to arrange the gauges horizontally.
Inside the horizontal-stack, create mini-gauge-card instances for "Load", "Solar PV", "Grid", and "Battery".
Customize each mini-gauge-card:
entity: Replace with your actual power sensor entities (e.g., sensor.load_power, sensor.solar_pv_power, sensor.grid_power, sensor.battery_power).
name: Set the label below the gauge (e.g., "Load").
units: Set the unit (e.g., "W").
min, max: Set appropriate minimum and maximum values for the gauges based on your system's power ranges.
segments: You can customize color segments within the gauge if desired, though Solar-Assistant's gauges are fairly monochromatic.
show: You can likely hide features like the needle and title to achieve a cleaner look more like Solar-Assistant's if needed using show:{needle: false, title: false} (check mini-gauge-card documentation).
style: Use card-mod if you need more advanced CSS styling to remove borders, change fonts, etc.
<!-- end list -->

YAML

type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:mini-gauge-card
    entity: sensor.load_power # Replace with your Load power entity
    name: Load
    units: W
    min: 0
    max: 2000 # Example max - adjust based on your system
    # show: { needle: false, title: false } # Optional styling
  - type: custom:mini-gauge-card
    entity: sensor.solar_pv_power # Replace with your Solar PV power entity
    name: Solar PV
    units: W
    min: 0
    max: 2000 # Example max - adjust
  # ... (Similar configuration for Grid and Battery gauges, replacing with your entities)
4. Time Series Chart:

Component: Line graph displaying power data over time.

Home Assistant Cards:

apexcharts-card (HACS): This is the best option for creating highly customizable and visually rich charts like the Solar-Assistant one. It's very powerful and flexible.
mini-graph-card (HACS): A simpler option than apexcharts-card, good for basic line graphs but less customization.
history-graph (Built-in): The built-in history graph is very basic and unlikely to match the Solar-Assistant style well.
Implementation Steps (using apexcharts-card - recommended for best result):

Install apexcharts-card via HACS.
Create an apexcharts-card.
Configure the series:
Add a series entry for each line in the chart (Load Power, Grid Power, PV Power, Battery Power).
For each series, specify the entity (e.g., entity: sensor.load_power), name (e.g., "Load power"), and color (match Solar-Assistant colors or choose your own).
Configure chart_type: line.
Configure xaxis:
type: datetime
tickAmount: 7 or similar (adjust to get similar x-axis labels)
labels: { format: 'HH:00' } to format time labels to hours only.
Configure yaxis:
decimals: 0 to have whole number power values.
Configure legend: { show: true } to display the legend below the chart.
Adjust height, width, padding, and other styling options in apexcharts-card to match the look and feel of the Solar-Assistant chart.
<!-- end list -->

YAML

type: custom:apexcharts-card
chart_type: line
series:
  - entity: sensor.load_power # Replace with your Load power entity
    name: Load power
    color: blue # Choose colors to match Solar-Assistant or your preference
  - entity: sensor.grid_power # Replace with your Grid power entity
    name: Grid power
    color: orange
  - entity: sensor.solar_pv_power # Replace with your PV power entity
    name: PV power
    color: yellow
  - entity: sensor.battery_power # Replace with your Battery power entity
    name: Battery power
    color: green # Or another color if Battery power in SA is different
xaxis:
  type: datetime
  tickAmount: 7 # Adjust tick amount as needed
  labels:
    format: HH:00
yaxis:
  decimals: 0
legend:
  show: true
height: 200px # Adjust height
# ... (Add more styling options from apexcharts-card documentation)
5. Footer/Status Bar:

This is likely just a URL. You could recreate this using a simple markdown card if you want to display a similar text.
Important Considerations and Next Steps:

Data Entities are Key: The most crucial step is identifying the correct Home Assistant entities that provide the data you need for each part of the dashboard (power, energy, voltage, battery percentage, etc.). This depends entirely on how your solar system and inverter are integrated with Home Assistant (e.g., Modbus, specific inverter integrations, cloud integrations).
Start Simple, Iterate: Begin by creating basic versions of each component. Once you have the data displaying correctly, then focus on styling and fine-tuning the appearance to match Solar-Assistant.
Consult Card Documentation: Read the documentation for button-card, mini-gauge-card, apexcharts-card, and card-mod (for CSS styling) thoroughly. These cards have many options for customization.
CSS Styling with card-mod: If you want to get very close to the Solar-Assistant visual style, you'll likely need to use card-mod to apply CSS styling to remove borders, change fonts, adjust padding, etc., on the cards. This can take time and some CSS knowledge.
Explore Solar Assistant Integrations: Search Home Assistant integrations to see if there is already a Solar Assistant integration available. If so, it might provide entities that are already nicely formatted and make data retrieval easier.
By following these steps and substituting the example entities with your actual Home Assistant solar data entities, you'll be well on your way to recreating a functional and visually similar Solar-Assistant dashboard in Home Assistant! Remember to break it down into smaller pieces and iterate. Good luck!
