i'm creating a weather dashboard in home assistant based on the attached dashboard that i found we have a tempest weatherflow station
here is a list of the exact weatherflow sensors names we have in our system alreadywe need help re-designing the dashboard but with our sensorsmake new sensors with data from other sources to replace the sensors we don't have, but need to truly replicate the dashboard belowWe like the styling and layout, we dont want to change those at all if we can help itSensor list

analyze the sensors we have, make a detailed plan of how to adapt the codebase to our applicationAfter this intial step
we'll review our configuration.yaml file for context, suggest changes we need to make or feautres we need, or cards etc to make this go perfectly, dont be lazy!EditI'll help you redesign your weather dashboard using your WeatherFlow Tempest station sensors while maintaining the styling and layout of the reference dashboard. Let's analyze both the dashboard you want to replicate and your available sensors, then create a detailed implementation plan.
Dashboard Analysis
The reference dashboard has several card components:

Outdoor temperature and humidity card
Wind speed and gust card
Wind direction card
Windrose card for visualizing wind patterns
Rain rate card
Pressure card
Greenhouse temperature and humidity card with soil moisture
Indoor temperatures across multiple rooms
Solar radiation card
Weather radar map
Air quality card (CO2, PM10, PM2.5)
Another soil moisture card
Elbe water level card

Most cards use the custom:mini-graph-card component with similar configuration patterns:

Time period display: 12-24 hours
Points per hour: 2-12 points
Consistent line styling
State display with adaptive colors
Various show/hide toggles for labels, icons, etc.

Sensor Analysis
You have a comprehensive set of WeatherFlow Tempest sensors that cover most of the weather data in the reference dashboard:

Temperature, humidity, and feels like
Wind data (direction, speed, gust, lull)
Air pressure
Precipitation data
Solar data (UV, illuminance, irradiance)
Lightning data

Missing sensors compared to the reference dashboard:

Indoor temperature sensors for multiple rooms
Greenhouse sensors
Soil moisture sensors
Air quality sensors (CO2, PM10, PM2.5)
Specific water level data (Elbe)

Implementation Plan
1. Direct Sensor Replacements

2. Create Missing Sensors
Let's tackle the sensors that require creation:
Rain Rate Sensor
The Tempest has precipitation data but we need to format it to match the reference dashboard:

Use sensor.st_00174194_precipitation_intensity for the rain rate
Create a daily accumulation sensor for the total daily rain

Indoor Temperature Sensors

Need to add temperature sensors for different rooms if you have them
If not, we'll note that additional hardware is needed

Greenhouse and Soil Moisture

Need additional hardware if you want to monitor these

Air Quality

Need additional hardware (like a Airthings, Awair, or other air quality monitor)

Elbe Water Level

Need to create a sensor that fetches public data for this, or replace with a different relevant water body

3. Dashboard Implementation
Now, let's create the YAML configuration for your new dashboard:WeatherFlow Tempest Dashboard ConfigurationClick to open codeTap to openRequired Custom Components
To implement this dashboard, you'll need to install the following HACS custom components:

mini-graph-card - For the time-series visualizations
windrose-card - For the wind direction visualization
weather-radar-card - For the radar visualization

Implementation Details and Additions to configuration.yaml
Let's create the necessary sensor configurations you'll need to add to your configuration.yaml file:Additions to configuration.yamlClick to open codeTap to openMissing Hardware and Additional Components Needed
To fully replicate the reference dashboard, you'll need:

Indoor Temperature Sensors:

Consider Zigbee or Z-Wave temperature sensors for each room (Aqara, Sonoff, etc.)
Alternatively, smart thermostats often expose temperature readings


Greenhouse Monitoring:

Temperature/humidity sensors rated for greenhouse use
I recommend Dragino LSN50-v2 LoRaWAN sensors if you have LoRaWAN coverage
Alternatively, Bluetooth sensors like Xiaomi/Mijia/Aqara sensors can work for shorter ranges


Soil Moisture Sensors:

Capacitive soil moisture sensors are better than resistive ones (last longer)
Miflora, Xiaomi plant sensors, or DIY ESP32-based sensors with capacitive moisture probes


Air Quality Monitoring:

For a complete solution: Airthings View Plus, Awair Element
Budget option: DIY with ESP32 + sensors (PM2.5, CO2, etc.)
Qingping or Xiaomi Air Monitor provide basic PM2.5 readings


Water Level Data:

Find an API for water level monitoring in your area
Alternative: use weather service flood warning API if available



Complete Integration Plan
Here's a detailed step-by-step plan for implementation:

Install Required Custom Components:
bashCopy# Using HACS
# Add these custom repositories:
# https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card

Add the Configuration Additions to your configuration.yaml file.
Create the Dashboard:

In Home Assistant, go to Configuration → Dashboards
Create a new dashboard or edit existing
Add the YAML code from the dashboard artifact
Customize entity IDs as needed


Purchase Additional Hardware (if needed):

Indoor temperature sensors
Soil moisture sensors
Air quality sensors


Adjust and Refine:

Use Developer Tools → States to verify sensor readings
Adjust card styling as needed for your preferences
Add description text entities where needed



Additional Customization Options
To enhance your weather dashboard:

Forecasts Integration:
yamlCopy# Add to configuration.yaml
weather:
  - platform: met
    name: Home

Statistics Cards:
yamlCopy# Add to your dashboard
- type: statistics-graph
  entity: sensor.st_00174194_temperature
  name: Temperature Statistics
  stat_types:
    - mean
    - min
    - max
  period:
    calendar:
      period: month

Weather Alerts:
Consider adding weather alerts based on thresholds, such as:

Wind speed exceeding 30 mph
Temperature dropping below freezing
Rain rate exceeding a certain amount


Historical Comparisons:
Use template sensors to compare current conditions to yesterday or same day last year (requires history stats).
